For buxton_open, a "file descriptor" is returned.  It will be >=0 if a connection was successful. Otherwise it will be a negative number and considered a failure.

Also, the daemon debug says 
	main():[312]: New client fd 5 connected through fd 4
	add_pollfd():[990]: Added fd 5 to our poll list (accepting=0)
	add_pollfd():[998]: Removing fd 5 from out list
	terminate_client():[1221]: Closed connection from fd 5
